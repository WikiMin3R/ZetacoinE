[MANDATORY UPDATE]

New in Zetacoin v0.14.1.2-2021-network-rollout:
1) Added checkpoints, up to block 6,001
2) Block reward remains as follows:
        [a] PoW - From 1.0 per block to ~0.1 per block (based on dedicated supply-demand analysis to optimize supply vs. demand)
        [b] PoS - This is a new feature and is intended primarily to maintain and secure the blockchain in the absence of PoW activity
            The fixed PoS reward is set at 0.0625 ZET 
3) Minor bug fixes identified during the compilation process
4) Added initial seed server to help ensure wallets auto-populate IP connections;
   More seeds will be developed as the network transitions from SHA256 to Scrypt/PoS
