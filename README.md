[MANDATORY UPDATE]

New in Zetacoin v0.14.1.1-pow-pos-transition:
1) Added checkpoints, up to block 1,001
2) Block reward reduction as follows:
        [a] PoW - From 1.0 per block to ~0.1 per block (based on dedicated supply-demand analysis to optimize supply vs. demand)
        [b] PoS - This is a new feature and is intended purely to maintain and secure the blockchain in the absence of PoW activity
            The fixed PoS reward is set at 0.0625 ZET
