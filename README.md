[DESCRIPTION]		 

Zetacoin (ZET) was introduced as a truly innovative cryptocurrency, based on Bitcoin and designed to combine transaction speed and ease-of-use. Zetacoin is a transparent, open-source network, in operation since August 3, 2013 and created by a team of anonymous developers. The original “Legacy Zetacoin” blockchain was based on SHA256 and featured ultra-fast block times, resulting in significant inefficiencies. The project was abandoned in 2018 with a small group of enthusiasts and hobbyists maintaining it. In late 2021, after a community consultation and a month-long Q&A period, the project successfully transitioned to a Scrypt-based, hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) code that addresses the inefficiencies of the original chain and ensures long-term sustainability. In addition to burn-based reduction in total coin supply, the new code upgrade limits annual supply of new ZET to <50,000 coins.

[MANDATORY UPDATE]

New in Zetacoin v0.14.1.3-2021-network-rollout:
1) Added checkpoints, up to block 731,001
2) Block reward remains as follows:
        [a] PoW - From 1.0 per block to ~0.1 per block (based on dedicated supply-demand analysis to optimize supply vs. demand)
        [b] PoS - This is a new feature and is intended primarily to maintain and secure the blockchain in the absence of PoW activity
            The fixed PoS reward is set at 0.0625 ZET 
3) Minor bug fixes identified during the compilation process
4) Added initial seed info / servers to help ensure wallets auto-populate IP connections
5) Updating wallet graphics to make the feel more customized / original!
6) Updated all namespace information throughout the code (e.g., "9..." address nomenclature)
