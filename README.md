What is Zetacoin?
----------------

Zetacoin is a well-established, yet experimental digital currency that enables 
instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Zetacoin uses peer-to-peer 
technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and UTXO 
issuance are carried out collectively by the network. Zetacoin Core is the name 
of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Zetacoin Core software, see https://ewmci.info

License

Zetacoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more

Development Process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Zetacoin
development team members simply pulls it.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/zetacoin/zetacoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Zetacoin.

Testing
-------

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
